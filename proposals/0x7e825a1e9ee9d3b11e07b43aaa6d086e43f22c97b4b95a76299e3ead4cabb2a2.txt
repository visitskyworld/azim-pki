The state of Urbit ID shall be determined by feeding events into the nock 4K
program whose keccak256 hash is 

0xf72a.cad7.5633.afa0.c019.8b1c.e7a4.270d.122f.d73f.bab9.ae53.7049.cb33.ec8c.4f2c

These events will be logs from Azimuth[0] and Ecliptic[1] plus batches from the
Roller contract[2].

This will take effect on November 9, 2021 at 9pm UTC.  It will apply
retroactively to all events and batches corresponding to those contracts.

This nock program may be upgraded in the future by a vote of the galaxies.

Before November 9, 2021 at 9pm UTC, if the Tlon Corporation discovers a security
vulnerability, it may unilaterally cancel this change by publishing a statement
to that effect.  In that case, the galaxies may pass an amended proposal.
